**Big O notation**
- describes the performance of an algorithm as the amount of data increases
- machine independent (# of steps to completion)
- ignore smaller operations O(n + 1) -> O(n)
- Express the upper bound of an algorithm's running time
- Upper bound means for any given input this notation determines longest amount of time an algorithm can take to complete
- Example : If an algorithm takes 100 secs to complete, then the upper bound is 100 secs. The algorithm can take less than 100 secs to complete but not more than 100secs

 **Rules
 

example :  n = amount of data
O(1)
O(n)
O(log n)
O(nÂ²)
