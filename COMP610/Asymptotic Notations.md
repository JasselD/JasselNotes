-  Mathematical tools used to describe the running time of an algorithm in terms of input size

**Types of notations**
- ****Big-O Notation (O-notation)****
2. ****Omega Notation (Ω-notation)****
3. ****Theta Notation (Θ-notation)****

**Omega 
- Formal way to express the lower bound of an algorithm's running time
- Lower bound means for any given input this notation determines best amount of time an algorithm can take to complete

[[Big O notation]]

**Theta
- Express both the upper and lower bounds of an algorithm's running time
- By lower and upper bounds means for any given input this notation determines "average" amount of time an algorithm can complete
