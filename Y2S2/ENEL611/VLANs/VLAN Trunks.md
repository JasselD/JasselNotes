**VLAN Trunk**
- A trunk is a point-to-point link between two network devices (like switches) that can carry traffic for multiple VLANs
- Trunks allow VLAN traffic to travel between switches, so devices on different switches but in the same VLAN can communicate directly without needing a router
- Purpose:
	- Transport multiple VLANs over a single link
	- Does not belong to any specific VLAN, it acts as a conduit
	- Trunks are essential for VLAN
