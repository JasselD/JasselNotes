**Network  With VLANs**
- VLANs and Switch Port Configuration
	- VLANs are associated with individual switch ports
	- Devices connected to these ports do not  directly understand VLANs, they only know their IP network
	- VLANs and IP Networks:
		- A VLAN is equivalent to an IP network (or subnet)
		- The switch is configured with VLANs, while IP addressing is configured on the devices
- Scenario (Network with Two VLANs):
	- The network is segmented into two VLANs:
		- VLAN 10 for facu
- Broadcast Traffic in VLANs:
	- Faculty Computer (PC1) in VLAN 10 sends a broadcast frame
	- Switch S2 receives the broadcast and forwards it only to the ports configured for VLAN 10
	- Trunk Ports:
		- Ports F0/1 and F0/3 are trunk ports connecting switches (S1, S2, S3) and allow traffic for all VLANs
- How It Travel in VLANs:
	- When S
