**Network  With VLANs**
- VLANs and Switch Port Configuration
	- VLANs are associated with individual switch ports
	- Devices connected to these ports do not  directly understand VLANs, they only know their IP network
	- VLANs and IP Networks:
		- A VLAN is equivalent to an IP network (or subnet)
		- The switch is configured with VLANs, while IP addressing is configured on the devices
- Scenario (Network with Two VLANs)
