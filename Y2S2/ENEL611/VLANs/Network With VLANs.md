**Network  With VLANs**
- VLANs and Switch Port Configuration
	- VLANs are associated with individual switch ports
	- Devices connected to these ports do not  directly understand VLANs, they only know their IP network
	- VLANs and IP Networks:
		- A VLAN is equivalent to an IP network (or subnet)
		- The switch is configured with VLANs, while IP addressing is configured on the devices
- Scenario (Network with Two VLANs):
	- The network is segmented into two VLANs:
		- VLAN 10 for faculty devices
		- VLAN 20 for student devices
- Broadcast Traffic in VLANs:
	- Faculty Computer (PC1) in VLAN 10 sends a broadcast frame
	- Switch S2 receives the broadcast and forwards it only to the ports configured for VLAN 10
	- Trunk Ports:
		- Ports F0/1 and F0/3 are trunk ports connecting switches (S1, S2, S3) and allow traffic for all VLANs
- How It Travel in VLANs:
	- When S1 receives the broadcast frame from S2 on port F0/1, it forwards it to port F0/3 (the trunk port connected to S3)
	- S3 receives the broadcast frame on F0/3 and forwards it to PC4 on F0/11 (the port for VLAN 10)
	- PC4 (faculty device) receives the broadcast frame, and the transmission is restricted to VLAN 10 devices
- VLANs Limit Broadcast Traffic
	- Unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic from a host is s
