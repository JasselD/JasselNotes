**Data VLANs**
- A Data VLAN is used to seperate user-generated traffic
- Often called a User VLAN because it groups users or devices based on department, function, or team
- Helps in segmenting network traffic to improve performance, management, and security
- Purpose:
	- Carries only user data traffic e.g web browsing, emails, business applications
	- Voice traffic and network management traffic should NOT be allowed on Data VLANs
	- Organisations can have multiple Data VLANs depending on:
		- Departments (HR, IT, SALES)
		- Teams (Development, Support)
		- Functions (Students, Staff)
- Example:
	- VLAN 10 = IT Department
