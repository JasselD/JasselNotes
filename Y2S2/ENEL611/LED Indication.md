1. SYST
	- **System LED**
	    The LED shows the system's power and status. If it's off, the system is not powered on. A green LED means the system is functioning normally, while an amber LED indicates the system is powered but not operating properly.
2. RPS
	- **Redundant Power System (RPS) LED**
		The RPS LED shows the status of the RPS. If the LED is off, the RPS is either off or not properly connected. A green LED indicates that the RPS is connected and ready to provide backup power. If the LED blinks green, the RPS is connected but unavailable because it is powering another device. An amber LED means the RPS is in standby mode or experiencing a fault. If the LED blinks amber, it indicates that the internal power supply in the switch has failed, and the RPS is supplying power.
3. STAT
	- **Port Status LED**
