1. SYST
	- **System LED**
	    The LED shows the system's power and status. If it's off, the system is not powered on. A green LED means the system is functioning normally, while an amber LED indicates the system is powered but not operating properly.
2. RPS
	- **Redundant Power System (RPS) LED**
		Shows the RPS status. If the LED is off, the RPS is off, or it is not properly connected. If the LED is green, the RPS is connected and ready to provide backup power. If the LED is blinking green, the RPS is connected but is unavailable because it is providing power to another device. If the LED is amber, the RPS is in standby mode, or in a fault condition. If the LED is blinking amber, the internal power supply in the switch has failed, and the RPS is providing power.
