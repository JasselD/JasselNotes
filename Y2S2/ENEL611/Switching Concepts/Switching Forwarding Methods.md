Fast Decisions with ASICs
- Switches use application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to make very fast Layer 2 forwarding decisions
- ASICs reduce frame-handling time and allow the switch to process more frame without slowing down

**Two Main Switching Methods**
- Store-and-Forwarding Switching (Cisco's primary method)
	- Switch waits and receive the entire frame
	- It performs a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
