This is a more in-depth explaination

No Error Checking
- No FCS check is done
- As a result, invalid(corrupt) frames might get forwarded
- Store-and-Forward, on the other hand, drops invalid frames after FCS verification

Rapid Frame Switching
- The switch begins forwarding immediately after reading the destination MAC address and finding the corresponding port in the MAC address table
- Faster forwarding speed compared to Store-and-Forward
- Prioritizes speed over error detection
