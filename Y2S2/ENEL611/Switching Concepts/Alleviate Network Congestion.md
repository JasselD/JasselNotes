How LAN Switches Help Reduce Congestion
- Switch ports try to establish full-duples connections by default, which eliminates collision domains
- Each full-duplex port provides full bandwidth to the connected devices(s)
- Full-duplex is required for 1 Gbps Ethernet and faster speeds
- Switches improve LAN performance by:
	- Interconnecting LAN segments
	- Using MAC address tables to forward frames efficiently
	- Reducing or completely eliminating collisions

Switch Characteristics That Reduces Congestion
- Fast Port Speeds
	- Access Layer Switches:
		- Support 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps ports
	- Distribution Layer Switches:
		- Support 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and 10 Gbps ports
	- Core/Data Center Switches:
		- Support 10 Gbps, 40 Gbps, and 100 Gbps ports
	- Note: Faster switches cost more but significantly reduce congestions
- Fast Internal Switching:
	- Switches use fast internal buses or shared memory
	- Help deliver high performance by moving frames quickly inside the switch
- Large Frame buffers:
	- Switches store more incoming frames temporarily without dropping them
	- Especially helpful when traffic goes from fast ports (1 Gbps) to slower ports (100 Mbps)
- High Port Density:
