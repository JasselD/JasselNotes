How LAN Switches Help Reduce Congestion
- Switch ports try to establish full-duples connections by default, which eliminates collision domains
- Each full-duplex port provides full bandwidth to the connected devices(s)
- Full-duplex is required for 1 Gbps Ethernet and faster speeds
- Switches improve LAN performance by:
	- Interconnecting LAN segments
	- Using MAC address tables to forward frames efficiently
	- Reducing or completely eliminating collisions

Switch Characteristics That Reduces Congestion
- Fast Port Speeds
	- Access Layer Switches:
		- Support 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps ports
	- Distribution Layer Swi
