**Legacy Device**
- Old networking devices that were designed before modern networking standards (like VLAN tagging, high-speed Ethernet, or wireless)
- Examples:
	- Early switches, hubs, or network cards that don't support VLAN tags
	- Older servers, printers, or industrial machines connected to network

**Legacy Traffic**
- Network traffic generated by these old devices that:
	- Does not have VLAN tags
	- Is treated as "untagged" traffic by modern switches
- Because these devices don't understand or insert VLAN tags, their traffic moves across the network without a VLAN ID
