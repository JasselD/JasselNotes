**Controlling Access to Network Devices**
SSH & Telnet
- What?
	- Secure Shell (SSH) and Telnet are remote access protocols used to control network devices
- Why?
	- These protocols allow remote configuration and management of devices
- How?
	- SSH:
		- Secure, encrypted access to devices using a public/private key pair of devices
	- Telnet:
		- Older, unencrypted method used for remote access

**Switch Operations & MAC Table**
- What?
	- Switches operate by forwarding frames based on MAC (Media Access Control) addresses stored in the MAC address table
- Why?
	- This mapping allows switches to efficiently forward traffic only to the correct port
- How?
	- Forwarding Methods:
		- Store and Forward
			- Stores entire frames and checks for errors before and forwarding
		- Cut-Through
			- Forwards frames as soon as the destination MAC is recognized, without error checking
