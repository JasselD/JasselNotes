- What?
	- Logical grouping of devices in a network, regardless of their physical locations. Devices in the same VLAN can communicate directly with each other, while devices in different VLANs cannot communicate unless routed by a router or Layer 3 switch
- Why?
	- Segmentation:
		- VLANs divide a large broadcast domain into smaller, isolated broadcasr domains. This helps reduce broadcast traffic and improves network performance
		- Security:
			- VLANs provide a logical separation of devices. For example, finance devices can be in one VLAN, and HR devices can be in another, increasing security by limiting access
		- Simplified Management:
			- VLANs allow network administrators to group devices by function, even if they're spread across different physical location. This makes management easeir and more efficient
- How?
	- VLAN Tagging:
		- When device sends data, it is assigned a VLAN ID. This ID is added to the frame by the switch to tag the traffic as beloging to a specific VLAN
		- Trunk Links between switches use 802.1Q VLAN tagging to allow traffic from multiple VLANs to pass through a single physical link
	- Switch Port Modes:
		- A switch port can be in one of the following modes:
			- Access Mode:
				- The port is assigned to a single VLAN. Devices connected to the port are part of the VLAN
			- Trunk Mode:
				- THe port can carry traffic from multiple VLANs and tags each frame with the appropriate VLAN ID
