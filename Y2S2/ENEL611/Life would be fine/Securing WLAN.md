# Wireless Network Security
- What?
	- Wireless network security is crucial to protect the data transmitted over Wi-Fi networks from unauthorized access. Different Wi-Fi security protocols offer varying levels of encryption, authentication, and protection for data on a wireless network

# Wi-Fi Security Protocols
- WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):
	- What?
		- WEP is one of the earliest Wi-Fi security protocols and was designed to provide a level of security equivalent to what a wired network would have
		
		- It uses RC4 encryptoin to encrypt data, but WEP has several weaknesses, including short encryption keys and poor implementation, making it insecure by modern standards
		
	- Why avoid?
		- WEP is easilt cracked due to weak encryption and is considered obsolete. It is vulnerable to brute-force attacks and ket reuse attacks
	- When to use?
		- WEP should only be used in legacy systems where updating the security protocol is not an option
- WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):
	-
