# 802.1Q
- What?
	- 802.1Q is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">VLAN tagging protocol</mark> that allows <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">multiple VLANs to travel across a single physical link </mark>(<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">trunk link</mark>) between switches or other network devices
	- Adds a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">VLAN tag</mark> (4-byte header) to the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Ethernet frame</mark>, which includes the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">VLAN ID</mark>. This allows the receiving device to know which VLAN the frame belongs to
- Why?
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Efficient Use of Links</mark>:
		- Wihout 802.1Q, each VLAN would need its own physical link between switches, which is inefficient. VLAN tagging allow <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">multiple VLANs to share a single link</mark>
	- VLAN Identification:
		- 802.1Q ensures that each VLAN's traffic is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">identified and kept separate</mark>, even though it shares the same physical link
- How?
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Frame Tagging</mark>:
		- When a switch sends a frame over a trunk link, it adds a VLAN tag to the Ethernet frame
			- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID)</mark>:
				- Identifies the frame as an 802.1Q frame
			- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">VLAN ID</mark>:
				- The VLAN to which the frame belongs
			- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Priority bits</mark>:
				- Used for Quality of Service (QoS) traffic management
	- Trunking:
		- Trunk ports are configured to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">carry traffic from multiple VLANs</mark> by <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">tagging each frame with the appropriate VLAN ID</mark>

# Native VLAN
- What?
	- Native VLAN is the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">VLAN that does not get tagged on a trunk link</mark>. Frames that belong to the native VLAN are sent <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">without a VLAN tag</mark>, and this is the default behaviour for most switches
- Why?
	- Allows devices that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">do not support VLAN tagging to communicate with each other</mark> while still using 802.1Q trunking
	- Security Consideration:
		- Its recommended to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">change the Native VLAN from the default VLAN 1 to a different VLAN</mark> to prevent VLAN hopping attacks
- Default Behavior of Native VLAN:
	- Default native VLAN is VLAN 1. However, it's good practice to change it to a different VLAN for <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">security reasons</mark>
	- Native VLAN Mismatch:
		- If two devices connected via a trunk port have mismatched native VLANs, you will get a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">native VLAN mismatch error</mark>

## QNA
- What is 802.1Q tagging used for in a network?
	- **802.1Q** tagging is used to allow **multiple VLANs** to travel across a **single physical link** between switches. It **tags** each frame with a **VLAN ID** so that the receiving switch knows which VLAN the frame belongs to.
	
- What is the purpose of the Native VLAN in trunking?
	- The **Native VLAN** is the **VLAN** whose traffic is **not tagged** on a trunk link. It allows devices that do not support VLAN tagging to communicate over a trunk link.
	
- What happens to frames beloging to the Native VLAN on a trunk link?
	- Frames belonging to the **Native VLAN** are **sent without a VLAN tag** on a trunk link. This allows communication between devices that don't support VLAN tagging.
	
- What is the default Native VLAN on most Cisco switches?
	- The **default Native VLAN** on most Cisco switches is **VLAN 1**. However, for security reasons, it is recommended to change this to another VLAN.
