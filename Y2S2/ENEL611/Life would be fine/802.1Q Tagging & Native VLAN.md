**802.1Q**
- What?
	- 802.1Q is a VLAN tagging protocol that allows multiple VLANs to travel across a single physical linl (trunk link) between switches or other network devices
	- Adds a VLAN tag (4-byte header) to the Ethernet frame, which includes the VLAN ID. This allows the receiving device to know which VLAN the frame belongs to
- Why?
	- Efficient Use of Links:
		- Wihout 802.1Q, each VLAN would need its own physical link between switches, which is inefficient. VLAN tagging allow multiple VLANs to share a single link
	- VLAN Identification:
		- 802.1Q ensures that each VLAN's traffic is identified and kept separate, even though it shares the same physical link
- How?
	- Frame Tagging:
		- When a switch sends a frame over a trunk link, it adds a VLAN tag to the Ethernet frame
			- Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID):
				- Identifies the frame as an 802.1Q frame
			- VLAN ID:
				- The VLAN to which the frame belongs
			- Priority bits:
				- Used for Quality of Service (QoS) traffic management
	- Trunking:
		- Trunk ports are configured to carry traffic from multiple VLANs by tagging each frame with the appropriate VLAN ID

**Native VLAN**
- What?
	- Native VLAN is the VLAN that does not get tagged on a trunk link. Frames that belong to the native VLAN are sent without a VLAN tag, and this is the default behaviour for most switches
- Why?
	- Allows devices that do not support VLAN tagging to communicate with each other while still using 802.1Q trunking
	- Security Consideration:
		- Its recommended to change the Native VLAN from the default VLAN 1 to a different VLAN to prevent VLAN hopping attacks
- Default Behavior of Native VLAN:
	- Default native VLAN is VLAN 1. However, it's good practice to change it to a different VLAN for security reasons
	- Native VLAN Mismatch:
		- If two devices connected via a trunk port have mismatched native VLANs, you will get a native VLAN mismatch error

- What is 802.1Q tagging used for in a network?
	- **802.1Q** tagging is used to allow **multiple VLANs** to travel across a **single physical link** between switches. It **tags** each frame with a **VLAN ID** so that the receiving switch knows which VLAN the frame belongs to.
	
- What is the purpose of the Native VLAN in trunking?
	- The **Native VLAN** is the **VLAN** whose traffic is **not tagged** on a trunk link. It allows devices that do not support VLAN tagging to communicate over a trunk link.
	
- What happens to frames beloging to the Native VLAN on a trunk link?
	- Frames belonging to the **Native VLAN** are **sent without a VLAN tag** on a trunk link. This allows communication between devices that don't support VLAN tagging.
	
- What is the default Native VLAN on most Cisco switches?
	- The **default Native VLAN** on most Cisco switches is **VLAN 1**. However, for security reasons, it is recommended to change this to another VLAN.
