- What?
	- 802.1Q is a VLAN tagging protocol that allows multiple VLANs to travel across a single physical linl (trunk link) between switches or other network devices
	- Adds a VLAN tag (4-byte header) to the Ethernet frame, which includes the VLAN ID. This allows the receiving device to know which VLAN the frame belongs to
- Why?
	- Efficient Use of Links:
		- Wihout 802.1Q, each VLAN would need its own physical link between switches, which is inefficient. VLAN tagging allow multiple VLANs to share a single link
	- VLAN Identification:
		- 802.1Q ensures that each VLAN's traffic is identified and kept separate, even though it shares the same physical link
- How?
	- Frame Tagging:
		- When a switch sends a frame over a trunk link, it adds a VLAN tag to the Ethernet frame
			- Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID):
				- Identifies the frame as an 802.1Q frame
			- VLAN ID:
				- The VLAN to which the frame belongs
