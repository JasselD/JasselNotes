- What?
	- Layer 2 protocol used to prevent loops in a network with redundant paths
	- Loops occur when multiple network path exist between switches, and without STP, frames could circulate endlessly, causing a broadcast storm and network congestion
	- STP ensures there is only one active path between any two devices in a network, blocking the redundant paths to avoid loops
- Why?
	- Loop Prevention:
		- Without STP, switches would broadcast traffic to all ports. When loops exist, the traffic gets duplicated, causing the network to become unresponsive
	- Redundancy:
		- STP allows network redundancy. If one link fails, STP automatically activates a backup path, keeping the network stable and available
- How?
	- Root Bridge Election:
		- STP elects a Root Bridge, which is the central reference point for the network. This bridge is chosen based on the lowest Bridge ID (priority + MAC address)
		- Why? The Root Bridge serves as the logical center of the network, and all switches calculate the bes
