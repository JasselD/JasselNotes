- What?
	- Layer 2 protocol used to prevent loops in a network with redundant paths
	- Loops occur when multiple network path exist between switches, and without STP, frames could circulate endlessly, causing a broadcast storm and network congestion
	- STP ensures there is only one active path between any two devices in a network, blocking the redundant paths to avoid loops
- Why?
	- Loop
