- What?
	- Layer 2 protocol used to prevent loops in a network with redundant paths
	- Loops occur when multiple network path exist between switches, and without STP, frames could circulate endlessly, causing a broadcast storm and network congestion
	- STP ensures there is only one active path between any two devices in a network, blocking the redundant paths to avoid loops
- Why?
	- Loop Prevention:
		- Without STP, switches would broadcast traffic to all ports. When loops exist, the traffic gets duplicated, causing the network to become unresponsive
	- Redundancy:
		- STP allows network redundancy. If one link fails, STP automatically activates a backup path, keeping the network stable and available
- How?
	- Root Bridge Election:
		- STP elects a Root Bridge, which is the central reference point for the network. This bridge is chosen based on the lowest Bridge ID (priority + MAC address)
		- Why? The Root Bridge serves as the logical center of the network, and all switches calculate the best path to it
	- Port Roles:
		- Once the Root Bridge is elected, each switch determines the role of each port relative to the Root Bridge. This port roles include:
			- Root Port (RP):
				- The port on a switch that has the shortest path to the Root Bridge
			- Designated Port (DP):
				- The port on a switch that sends traffic towards the network segment. It is the forwarding port
			- Blocked/Alternative Port:
				- Ports that are not forwarding traffic to prevent loops
	- STP States:
		- Blocking:
			- The port does not forward frames and is not part of the forwarding path
		- Listening:
			- The switch listens to BDPUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units) to learn network topology changes
		- Learning:
			- The switch builds its MAC table but does not forward frames yet
		- Forwarding:
			- The port forwards traffic and is part of the active forwarding path
	- BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units):
		- BDPUs are special frames exchanged between switches to share topology information. They help in the Root Bridge election and are used to maintain the network's spanning tree structure
