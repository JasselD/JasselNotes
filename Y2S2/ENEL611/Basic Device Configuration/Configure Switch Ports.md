**Manual Switch Port Configuration**

- Switch ports can be manually set with specific **duplex** and **speed** settings
    
- Use the `duplex` interface configuration mode command to set the duplex mode
    
- Use the `speed` interface configuration mode command to set the port speed
    
- Example: Both switches in a topology should be configured to **full-duplex at 100 Mbps**
