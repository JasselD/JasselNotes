- **Switch Port Configuration**
    
    - Switch ports can be configured independently for different needs
        
    - Configuration includes setting duplex modes, verifying settings, and troubleshooting issues
    
- **Full-Duplex Communication**
    
    - Allows simultaneous data transmission and reception (bidirectional)
        
    - Requires **microsegmentation** (one device per switch port)
        
    - Eliminates collision domains, improving network efficiency
    
- **Half-Duplex Communication**
    
    - Data flows in only one direction at a time (unidirectional)
        
    - Causes performance issues due to **collisions**
        
    - Common in older hardware like **hubs**, which have been replaced by full-duplex switches
