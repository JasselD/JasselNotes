# ACL
-  An Access Controls List (ACL) is a set of rules used by routers or firewalls to control incoming and outgoing network traffic
- Each rule defines whether to permit or deny packets based on various criteria like:
	- IP address
	- Protocol type
	- Port Number
	- Source/destination
- Think of ACLs as digital traffic cops filtering which data gets through

# Types of ACLs
- Standard ACL:
	- Filters traffic based only on source IP address
	- Granularity:
		- Basic
- Extended ACL
