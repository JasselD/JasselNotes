# Cloud Computing
- Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of computing devices such as storage, servers, databases, networking, software over the internet (the "cloud"), allowing users to access resources on-demand and pay-as-you-go

# Key Benefits
- Scalability:
	- Easily increase or decrease resources
- Cost Efficiency:
	- Pay only for what you use
- Accessibility:
	- Access from anywhere with an internet conenction
- Resilience:
	- Built-in redundancy and backup option
- Agility:
	- Fast deployment of services

# Types of Cloud Models
- Public Cloud:
	- Available to the general public via a pay-per-use or free model (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- Private Cloud:
	- Exclusive for one organization (e.g., a company or government agency)
- Hybrid Cloud:
	- Combines public and private clouds with shared architecture (e.g., sensitive data on private, other services on public)
- Custom Cloud:
	- Tailored to specific industries (e.g., healthcare, media) can be public or private

# Cloud Service Model
- IaaS:
	- You manage OS, storage, and apps (e.g., AWS EC2)
- PaaS:
	- Develop apps, provider manages the rest (e.g., Google App Engine)
- SaaS:
	- You use the app, everything else is managed (e.g., Gmail, Office 365)

# Short QNA
- **What is cloud computing?**  
    Cloud computing is the **delivery of computing services**—such as storage, servers, databases, networking, and software—over the internet, allowing users to access resources on-demand and pay only for what they use.
    
- **Name three key benefits of cloud computing.**  
    Three key benefits of cloud computing are **scalability**, **cost efficiency**, and **accessibility from anywhere** with an internet connection.
    
- **What does scalability mean in cloud computing?**  
    Scalability means the ability to **easily increase or decrease computing resources** based on demand.
    
- **How does cloud computing improve cost efficiency?**  
    Cloud computing improves cost efficiency by using a **pay-as-you-go model**, meaning users only pay for the resources they consume.
    
- **What is the main advantage of accessibility in cloud computing?**  
    The main advantage of accessibility is that **users can access cloud services from anywhere** as long as they have an internet connection.
    
- **What is a public cloud?**  
    A public cloud is a cloud infrastructure **available to the general public**, typically on a pay-per-use or free basis, provided by companies like **AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud**.
    
- **What is a private cloud?**  
    A private cloud is a **dedicated cloud environment used exclusively by one organization**, often for security or compliance reasons.
    
- **What is a hybrid cloud?**  
    A hybrid cloud is a model that **combines both public and private clouds**, allowing sensitive data to stay private while leveraging public resources for other operations.
    
- **Give an example of an IaaS service.**  
    An example of an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering is **AWS EC2**.
    
- **What is the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?**  
    In **IaaS**, the user manages the OS and applications; in **PaaS**, the user develops applications while the provider manages the infrastructure; and in **SaaS**, the provider manages everything, and the user simply uses the application.

# Long QNA
- **What is cloud computing and why has it become important in modern IT environments?**  
    Cloud computing is a method of delivering computing services—including servers, storage, databases, software, and more—over the internet ("the cloud"). It has become essential in modern IT because it **offers flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solutions** for businesses and individuals. Rather than owning and maintaining physical hardware, users can access powerful computing resources remotely, which **enhances productivity, resilience, and accessibility**.
    
- **Compare and contrast the four cloud deployment models: Public, Private, Hybrid, and Custom.**
    
    - A **public cloud** is provided by third-party vendors to the general public and offers services on a **pay-per-use** model.
        
    - A **private cloud** is used **exclusively by a single organization**, offering greater control and security.
        
    - A **hybrid cloud** integrates public and private clouds, enabling organizations to **store sensitive data privately** while using the public cloud for less critical operations.
        
    - A **custom cloud** is designed for specific industries like healthcare or media and may be public or private, depending on the need for **compliance and specialization**.  
        Each model offers a unique balance between **control, cost, flexibility, and security**.
        
- **Explain the three main cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.**
    
    - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** In this model, the cloud provider supplies **basic infrastructure like virtual machines and storage**, and the user is responsible for managing the operating system, applications, and data. Example: **AWS EC2**.
        
    - **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** The provider manages everything except the application logic. Users can **develop and deploy apps** without worrying about the infrastructure. Example: **Google App Engine**.
        
    - **Software as a Service (SaaS):** The provider manages the entire stack, and users simply **use the application** through a web interface. Example: **Gmail or Office 365**.  
        These models vary in control and convenience, with SaaS being the most managed and IaaS the least.
        
- **What are the business advantages of using cloud computing in terms of agility, resilience, and scalability?**  
    Cloud computing enhances **agility** by allowing organizations to **quickly deploy and scale applications** in response to changing demands. It increases **resilience** through built-in redundancy, automatic backups, and disaster recovery features. **Scalability** enables businesses to **expand or reduce resources instantly**, making it ideal for startups, seasonal workloads, and large-scale enterprises. Together, these benefits make cloud computing a **strategic asset** for any modern organization.
    
- **How does the pay-as-you-go model in cloud computing change traditional IT budgeting?**  
    The pay-as-you-go model transforms traditional IT budgeting by **eliminating large upfront costs** for hardware and infrastructure. Instead of purchasing and maintaining physical equipment, businesses can **pay only for the resources they use**, making budgeting more predictable and efficient. This model also reduces waste by scaling down resources during low demand, helping companies **optimize their IT spending** and focus on innovation.
