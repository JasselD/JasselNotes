# Network Security
- What?
	- Network security is the practice of protecting computer networks from unauthorized access, misues, malware, and attacks that could damage data or disrupt service
	- It involves policies, practices, and tools to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availabilty (CIA) of network data

# Common Types of Malware
- Virus:
	- Malicious code that attaches to legitimate files or programs and spreads when executed
	
- Trojan Horse:
	- Appears as a legitimate program but secretly performs malicious actions
	
- Spyware:

- Worm:
	- Self-replicating malware that spreads without user interaction
	
- Ransomware:
	- Encrypts user files and demands payment to unlock them

# Network-Based Attacks
- DDoS:
	- Overwhelms a server with traffic from multiple sources, causing a shutdown or service unavailability
	
- IP Spoofing:
	- An attacker fakes the source IP address to disguise their identity or redirect traffic
	
- Man-In-The-Middle:
	- Attacker intercepts communication between two parties to steal or alter data
	
- Phishing:
	- Fraudulent attempts (emails, links) to trick users into revealing sensitive information

# Security Principles (CIA Triad)
- Confidentiality:
	- Prevent unauthorized access to data
- Integrity:
	- Ensure data is not altered or tampered with
- Availability
