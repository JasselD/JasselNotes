# Network Security
- What?
	- Network security is the practice of protecting computer networks from unauthorized access, misues, malware, and attacks that could damage data or disrupt service
	- It involves policies, practices, and tools to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availabilty (CIA) of network data

# Common Types of Malware
- Virus:
	- Malicious code that attaches to legitimate files or programs and spreads when executed
	
- Trojan Horse:
	- Appears as a legitimate program but secretly performs malicious actions
	
- Spyware:
	- Secretly gathers information from a device without user knowledge
	
- Worm:
	- Self-replicating malware that spreads without user interaction
	
- Ransomware:
	- Encrypts user files and demands payment to unlock them

# Network-Based Attacks
- DDoS:
	- Overwhelms a server with traffic from multiple sources, causing a shutdown or service unavailability
	
- IP Spoofing:
	- An attacker fakes the source IP address to disguise their identity or redirect traffic
	
- Man-In-The-Middle:
	- Attacker intercepts communication between two parties to steal or alter data
	
- Phishing:
	- Fraudulent attempts (emails, links) to trick users into revealing sensitive information

# Security Principles (CIA Triad)
- Confidentiality:
	- Prevent unauthorized access to data
	
- Integrity:
	- Ensure data is not altered or tampered with
	
- Availability:
	- Ensure authorized users have access when needed

# Best Practices for Defense
- Use firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
- Keep software and OS updated
- Enforce strong password encryption
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  Regular security training for users
- Implement network segmentation to contain breaches

# Short QNA
- **What is the primary goal of network security?**  
    The primary goal of network security is to protect computer networks from unauthorized access, misuse, malware, and attacks that can harm data or disrupt services.
    
- **What are the three components of the CIA triad?**  
    The three components of the CIA triad are **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**.
    
- **What type of malware appears as a legitimate program but performs malicious actions?**  
    A **Trojan Horse** appears as a legitimate program but secretly performs malicious actions.
    
- **Which type of malware encrypts user files and demands payment?**  
    **Ransomware** encrypts user files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for access.
    
- **How does a worm differ from a virus?**  
    A **worm** self-replicates and spreads without user interaction, while a **virus** requires a host file to spread.
    
- **What is a DDoS attack?**  
    A **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** attack overwhelms a server with traffic from multiple sources to make the service unavailable.
    
- **What is IP spoofing?**  
    **IP spoofing** is when an attacker fakes the source IP address to disguise their identity or redirect network traffic.
    
- **What does a firewall do in a network?**  
    A **firewall** monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules to block unauthorized access.
    
- **Why is multi-factor authentication important?**  
    **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** enhances security by requiring more than one form of verification before granting access.
    
- **What is phishing?**  
    **Phishing** is a fraudulent attempt to trick users into revealing sensitive information, often through fake emails or websites.

# Long QNA
- **Explain the CIA triad and its significance in network security.**  
    The **CIA triad** stands for **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**—the three core principles of network security.
    
    - **Confidentiality** ensures that data is only accessible to authorized users, protecting it from unauthorized access or disclosure.
        
    - **Integrity** guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered during storage or transmission, ensuring its reliability.
        
    - **Availability** ensures that authorized users can access the information and services they need when they need them.  
        Together, these principles provide a comprehensive foundation for securing networks against threats.
        
- **Describe five common types of malware and how they operate.**
    
    - A **virus** attaches itself to legitimate files or programs and spreads when the host is executed by the user.
        
    - A **Trojan Horse** disguises itself as a harmless or useful program but secretly performs malicious tasks.
        
    - **Spyware** operates silently, collecting sensitive user data without their consent or knowledge.
        
    - A **worm** is a self-replicating program that spreads across networks without requiring user action.
        
    - **Ransomware** encrypts the user’s data and demands payment for the decryption key, effectively holding data hostage.
        
- **What are some common types of network-based attacks and their impact?**  
    Common network-based attacks include:
    
    - **DDoS attacks**, which flood a network with traffic, leading to service disruptions or complete shutdowns.
        
    - **IP spoofing**, where attackers fake an IP address to disguise their identity or reroute data maliciously.
        
    - **Man-in-the-Middle attacks**, where a third party intercepts and potentially alters communication between two entities.
        
    - **Phishing**, where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to steal sensitive data like usernames and passwords.  
        These attacks can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and damage to organizational reputation.
        
- **List and explain best practices that can improve network security.**  
    To enhance network security, organizations should adopt several best practices:
    
    - Use **firewalls** and **intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS)** to monitor and control traffic.
        
    - Keep all **software and operating systems updated** to patch known vulnerabilities.
        
    - Enforce **strong password policies** and encrypt stored credentials.
        
    - Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to add an extra layer of protection.
        
    - Provide **regular security training** to employees to help them recognize and respond to threats.
        
    - Implement **network segmentation** to isolate critical systems and contain breaches if they occur.  
        These steps collectively reduce the risk of security incidents and strengthen the organization’s defense posture.
