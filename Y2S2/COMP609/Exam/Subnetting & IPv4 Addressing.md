# IPv4 Addressing
- What?
	- IPv4 address ia a 32-bit hierarchical identifier assigned to each device on a network. It's written in dotted decimals format (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and consist of four octets (8 bits each)
	
	- Example IP:
		- 192.168.1.20 = 11000000.10101000.00000001.00010100 (binary)
		- This can be calculated in calculator app
		
	- Each octet ranges from 0 to 255

# IPv4 Structure
- Network Portion:
	- Identifies the network
	
- Host Portion:
	- Identifies the devices within that network
	
- Determined using the Subnet Mask

# IPv4 Address Classes (A, B, C)
- IPv4 addresses are traditionally grouped into classes to help define how many networks and hosts per network are possible
- Class A:
	- Starting Bits:
		- 0xxx
	- IP Range:
		  1.0.0.0 - 12
