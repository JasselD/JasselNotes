# Fiber Optic Cable
- Used for backbone cabing in high-traffic environments
- Ideal for point-to-point connections (e.g., between buildings in a campus)
- Transmits data as light, offering higher bandwidth and longer distance than copper

# Copper Cable
- More common for short-distance connections (e.g., within building)
- Uses electrical signals
- Cheaper but suffers from signal attenuation and electromagnetic interference (EMI)

![![Y2S2/COMP609/Exam/#*Table1]]Summary:
- Fiber is ideal for speed and distance, making it perfect for backbones and data centers. Copper remains economical
