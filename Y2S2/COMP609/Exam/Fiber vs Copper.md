# Fiber Optic Cable
- Used for backbone cabing in high-traffic environments
- Ideal for point-to-point connections (e.g., between buildings in a campus)
- Transmits data as light, offering higher bandwidth and longer distance than copper

# Copper Cable
- More common for short-distance connections (e.g., within building)
- Uses electrical signals
- Cheaper but suffers from signal attenuation and electromagnetic interference (EMI)

![![Y2S2/COMP609/Exam/#*Table1]]Summary:
- Fiber is ideal for speed and distance, making it perfect for backbones and data centers. Copper remains economical and practical for local connections

Long Answer:
- **Compare and contrast fiber optic and copper cables in terms of signal type, distance, and bandwidth.**  
    ‚û§ _Fiber optic cables use light signals, can transmit over long distances (up to kilometers), and offer very high bandwidth. In contrast, copper cables use electrical signals, are limited to short distances (less than 100 meters), and provide moderate bandwidth._
    
- **Why is fiber optic cable preferred for backbone cabling and high-traffic environments?**  
    ‚û§ _Fiber optic cables offer higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances. They are immune to electromagnetic interference, making them ideal for backbone networks that handle large volumes of data and span across multiple buildings._
    
- **Explain the disadvantages of using copper cables in environments with high electromagnetic interference.**  
    ‚û§ _Copper cables use electrical signals, which makes them vulnerable to electromagnetic interference (EMI). This can result in signal degradation, reduced performance, and potential data loss in high-interference areas._
    
- **Discuss why copper cables are still widely used despite the advantages of fiber optics.**  
    ‚û§ _Copper cables are more affordable and easier to install. For short-distance applications like within a building or office, copper provides sufficient performance and is cost-effective, making it a practical choice for many local network setups._
    
- **In a campus environment needing high-speed connectivity between buildings, which cable type would be most suitable and why?**  
    ‚û§ _Fiber optic cable is the most suitable because it supports long-distance transmission with high bandwidth and is immune to EMI. This makes it ideal for inter-building connections on a campus._
