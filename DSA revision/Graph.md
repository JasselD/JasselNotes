- Non-linear collection comprised of a set of vertices(nodes) and a set of edges(links which connect two nodes together)

**Directed graph
- Contains edges that will link nodes to each other
- Adjacency Matrix:

- Adjacency List:
	- Array list of linked list

- Big O: O(1)

**Weighted graph
- A graph where each of the edges also hold a data value

**Connected vs Disconnected graphs
- Fully connected graph is a graph where there is a path between every pair of vertices. From one vertex it is possible to travel to another vertex in the graph
- A graph is disconnected if there is no path from a vertex in to travel to one or more other vertices in the graph
