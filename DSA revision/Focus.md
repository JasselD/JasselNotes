- the stuff u did in all the labs, 
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">big O notation for data structures and their methods, </mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">may be a part on synchronization (you prob just synchronize an object should be pretty easy), </mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">learn the construction of the data structures, </mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">maybe include circular array too</mark>, 
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">learn either merge or quick sort (we were given a choice between the 2 last sem)</mark>,
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">know how to read functions and determine the time complexity (be careful with this because theyll prob chuck in a O(n) method so a single for loop can be O(n^2),</mark>
- know how hasmaps and hashsets work and how the hashcode assigne works, 
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">LIFO / FIFO (stack / queue),</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">how to balance avl trees,</mark>
- how the 3 types of dfs traversals work (preorder, inorder, postorder) 
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">the different sorting algorithms and their time complexities</mark>
---

- Part A 40 multichoice, followed by 6 written questions (40 marks + 30 marks)
- Part B choose 3 out of the 4 questions? ( 30 marks, 10 marks per question)
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">time complexity of the different linkedlist, array, sets, stack, queue, heaps</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">remember sets are O(n) implemented with array and linkedlist</mark>
- know how to use either merge sort or quick sort for O(nlogn) time complexity
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">know both linear search and binary search (also know the mathematical equation to prove both)</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">linear search = $(n⋅(n+1)​)/2n$</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">binary search = (1/(2^k)n = 1</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">know adjacency matrix and adjacency list and the difference</mark>
- hashmap
- circular array queue, queue built with array and linkedlist, know the difference, does linked queues need to be circular arrays?
- FIFO - QUEUE or LILO
- FILO - STACK
- know min heap and max heap
- AVL tree : know how to build a binary tree too, use numbers for avl, rotate avl
- non multichoice: implement a list with arrays (arraylist and its functions, allocatesize() method is provided)
- implement a linkedlist with functions
