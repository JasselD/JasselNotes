- BST
- Queue and Priority Queue
- Heap array
- AVL
- the stuff u did in all the labs, 
- big O notation for data structures and their methods, 
- may be a part on synchronization (you prob just synchronize an object should be pretty easy), 
- learn the construction of the data structures, 
- maybe include circular array too, 
- learn either merge or quick sort (we were given a choice between the 2 last sem),
- know how to read functions and determine the time complexity (be careful with this because theyll prob chuck in a O(n) method so a single for loop can be O(n^2),
- know how hasmaps and hashsets work and how the hashcode assigne works, 
- LIFO / FIFO (stack / queue),
- how to balance avl trees,
- how the 3 types of dfs traversals work (preorder, inorder, postorder) 
- the different sorting algorithms and their time complexities
- Part A 40 multichoice, followed by 6 written questions (40 marks + 30 marks)
- Part B choose 3 out of the 4 questions? ( 30 marks, 10 marks per question)
- time complexity of the different linkedlist, array, sets, stack, queue, heaps
- remember sets are O(n) implemented with array and linkedlist
- know how to use either merge sort or quick sort for O(nlogn) time complexity
- know both linear search and binary search (also know the mathematical equation to prove both)
- linear search = $(n⋅(n+1)​)/2n$
- binary search = (1/(2^k)n = 1
- know adjacency matrix and adjacency list and the difference
- hashmap
- circular array queue, queue built with array and linkedlist, know the difference, does linked queues need to be circular arrays?
- FIFO - QUEUE or LILO
- FILO - STACK
- know min heap and max heap
- AVL tree : know how to build a binary tree too, use numbers for avl, rotate avl
- non multichoice: implement a list with arrays (arraylist and its functions, allocatesize() method is provided)
- implement a linkedlist with functions
