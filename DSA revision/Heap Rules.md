- Non-linear collection and is a binary tree where each node has only at most k=2 children
- Balanced
- A min/ascending heap
	- leftChild > parent < rightChild
	- parent is less than children
- A max/descending heap
	- leftChild < parent > rightChild
	- parent is greater than children
- **Structure must be complete
	- If the nodes on the structure is in an array, there should not be any gaps in between nodes
