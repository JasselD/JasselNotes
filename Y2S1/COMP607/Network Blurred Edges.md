- Definition: Describes the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">overlap and integration between different network types</mark>, such as <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs)</mark>, and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">cloud networks</mark>. It indicates a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">lack of clear boundaries</mark> between these environments
- Causes:
	- **Multiple Entry Points**:
	    - Unlike a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">hard edge</mark> with a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">single data entry point</mark>, WLANs have <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">multiple entry points</mark> through various Access Points (APs)
	    - These <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">RF signals create several access points</mark> for data entry into the network
	- **Security Challenges**:
	    - Multiple entry points make it difficult to maintain a secure, hard network edge
	    - <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">RF signals can extend beyond building boundaries</mark>, meaning walls are not effective barriers against attackers
	- **Remote Threats**:
	    - Attackers can be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">positioned far outside the building's security perimeter</mark> (e.g., in a car) and still intercept RF signals
	    - This can allow them to eavesdrop on data transmissions or inject malware, bypassing firewalls
	- **AP Security Risks**:
	    - An Access Point with improper security settings can provide attackers with unauthorized access to the network
