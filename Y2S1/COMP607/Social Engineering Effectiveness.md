- Social Engineering: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Taking advantage of human behaviors and natural tendencies</mark>. It exploits the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">human psycology</mark> to manipulate people into<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> making security mistakes</mark> and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">giving away confidential information</mark>

***7 principles

**A.I.C.S.U.F.T

**Authority
- Description: To <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">impersonate an authority figure or falsely cite their authority</mark> to pressure the victim into compliance
- How it works: People tend to follow orders or requests from authority figures without question
- Example: An attacker poses as the CEO and requests sensitive information or access to systems, making the victim feel they must comply due to the perceived power imbalance

**Intimidation
- Description: To <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">use threats or aggressive language</mark> to frighten or coerce the victim into action
- How it works: Fear can make people act hastily, often overriding rational decision-making
- Example: An attacker threatens to report an employee to their supervisor if they don’t reset a password or provide access, creating a sense of fear and urgency

**Consensus (Social Proof)
- Description:<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Convinces the victim</mark> by <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">referencing what others have done similiar situations</mark>, making the victim feel that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">it's a standard or expected action</mark>
- How it works: People are more likely to act if they believe others have done the same
- Example: The attacker tells the victim that a colleague previously reset the password for them, creating the illusion that it’s normal procedure and pressuring the victim to do the same

**Scarcity
- Description: Attacker <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">claims that a resource or opportunity is in short supply</mark>, pressuring the victim to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">act quickly before it's too late</mark>
- How it works: People are more likely to act when they believe they might miss out on something important or rare
- Example: The attacker claims they are short on time and need immediate help, creating a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">sense of urgency</mark> that compels the victims to bypass normal security procedures

**Urgency
- Description: The attacker <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">emphasized that immediate action is necessary</mark>, forcing the victim to act quickly without throughly thinking it through
- How it works: Time pressure can cloud judgement, leading to rushed decisions
- Example: The attacker claims they have a meeting with the board of directors in five minutes and urgently need a password reset or access to certain files

**Familiarity
- Descripton: Pretends to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">know the victim's personally</mark> or <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">expresses positive familiarity</mark> to build rapport and reduce suspicion
- How it works: People are more likely to trust and help someone they believe they know or have a friendly connection with
- Example: The attacker tells the victim they’ve heard good things about them or met them at a previous company event, building false familiarity to gain the victim’s trust

**Trust
- Description: The attacker <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">inspires confidence</mark> by <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">acting trustworthy or referencing mutual connections</mark>, making the victim more likely to comply
- How it works: People are more likely to comply with requests from someone they believe is trustworthy
- Example: The attacker claims to be a known individual or uses professional language and tone to project confidence and reliability, tricking the victim into divulging information or performing actions
