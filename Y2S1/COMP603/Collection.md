A set of classes and interfaces that makes it easier to handle collections of objects

Their size can change dynamically, and they have more advanced behaviours than arrays

**List**
- an ordered collection permitting duplicates

**Set**
- a collection that contains no duplicate elements

**Maps**
- describes a mapping from keys to values, without duplicate keys

[[Hashset]]
- Elements are not ordered 
- Computes an int, i.e; hash code for each object
- The 'add' method of a set first tries to find the object to be added, then add it only when it is not yet present
