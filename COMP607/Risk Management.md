**Acceptance
- Involves <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">acknowledging a risk</mark> but <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">taking no action</mark> to mitigate. For example, Ellie accepts. the risk of her scooter being stolen because the parking lot has some hole in the fence, or an organisation might accept the risk of a rare flood affecting its plant

**Tranference:
- Involves <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">shifting the risk to a third party</mark>, such as <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">purchasing insurance</mark>. Ellie transfers the risk of theft to an insurance company, while an organisation might use cybersecurity insurance to cover potential losses from attacks

**Avoidance:
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Recognising a risk</mark> and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">choosing not to engage in the activity</mark>. For example, Ellie might avoid the risk of theft by deciding not to buy the scooter, and an organisation could avoid the risk of a bad investment by deciding not to build a new plant

**Mitigation
- Involves <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">taking actions to reduce the severity of the risk</mark>. Ellie could mitigate the risk of her scooter being stolen by having the hole in the fence repaired, while an organisation might mitigate security risks by installing a fence around its plant
