- Uses a person's <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">unique characteristics</mark> for authentication (what he/she is)
- Examples: Fingerprints, faces, hands, irises, retinas

**Physical  (Based on your body)
- Fingerprint scanner
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Dynamic (more secure)</mark>
		- Requires user to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">swipe or move their finger across the sensor</mark>. It captures <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">multiple images or scans of the finger</mark> as it moves across the sensor
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Static</mark>
		- Requires user to simply place their fingers on the scanner's surface and a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">single, still image of the fingerprint</mark> is captured
- Disadvantages
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Costs</mark>
	- Readers are not always foolproof
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Easy to be stolen</mark>

**Behavioural (Based on how you act)
- Voice recognition: Identifies you by <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">how you speak</mark>, including your <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">tone and rhythm</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Phonetic cadence</mark>
	- Refers to the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">rhythm and flow of speech</mark>, shaped by factors like <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">pitch, stress, pause, and speed</mark>
	- It involves how sounds are <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">arranged and emphasized</mark>, creating the natural rise and fall in spoken language
	- Convey <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">emotion, emphasis, and meaning</mark>, making speech more expressive and easier to undetand
	- Different languages and dialects have their own <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">unique cadences</mark>, contributing to their distinctive sound
- Computer footprint: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">When and from</mark> where a user normally accesses a system

**Cognitive (Based on how your brain works)
- Based on their <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">thoughts patterns/process, brain activity, and understanding of the user</mark>
- Easier for the user to remember because it is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">based on the user's life experiences</mark>
- Types:
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Brainwave Patterns (EEG)</mark>: Measures brain activity
	- Cognitive Responses: Look at how you react to certain questions or images, how quickly and accurately you respond can be unique to you
	- Eye movement: Tracks how your eyes move when you look at something or read
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Identify specific faces</mark>
