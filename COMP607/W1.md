**CIA 

Confidentiality - Only approved individuals should be able to access sensitive information

Integrity - Ensures that information is correct and no unauthorised person or malicious software has altered the data

Availability - Information has value if the authorised parties who are assured of its integrity can access the information

**Types of Hackers

Black hat hackers - Hack for personal gain and to inflict malicious damage

White hat hackers - Ethical attackers, find weaknesses and privately provide that information back to the org

Gray hat hackers - Attempt to break into a computer system without the org permission but not for their own advantage

**Script Kiddies
- Individuals who want to perform attacks
- Break into computers to cause damage
- Lack the technical knowledge to carry them out
- Download scripts to perform malicious acts

**Hacktivists 
- Strongly motivated by ideology 
- Breaking into a website and changing its contents as a mean of making a political statement

**Insiders
- Employees, Contractors, Business partner
- Intellectual property, Theft, Sabotage

**Defences 
Layering (defence in-depth)
- Information security must be created in layer
	 Unlikely that attacker can break through all defence layers
	  Single defence mechanism may be easy to circumvent
	  
- Layered security approach
	 Can be useful in resisting a variety of attacks
	 Provides the most comprehensive protection

**Limiting**
- Limiting access to information
	 Reduces the threat against it
	 
- Only those who must use data granted access
	 Amount of access limited to what that person needs to know
	 
- Methods of limiting access
	 Technology
	 - File permissions
	 Procedural
	 - Prohibiting document removal from premises

**Diversity**
- Closely related to layering
	 Layers must be different
	 
- If attackers penetrate one layer:
	 Same technique unsuccessful in breaking through other layers
	 
- Breaching one security layer does not compromise the whole system

**Obscurity**
- Obscuring inside details to outsiders
- Example :
	 Type of computer
	 Operating System version
	 Brand of software used
	 
- Difficult for attacker to devise attack if system details are known

**Simplicity**
- Nature of information security is complex
- Complex security systems
	 Difficult to understand and troubleshoot
	 Often compromised for ease of use by trusted user
	 
- Secure system should be simple
- Simple from the inside, complex from the outside
