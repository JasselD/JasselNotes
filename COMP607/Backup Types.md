**Types:
- Full Backup:
	- Complete copy of all data is made
	- Pros: Simple to restore
	- Cons: Time-consuming and requires a lot of storage
- Diffrential Backup: 
	- Backs up all the data that has changed since the last full backup
	- Pros: Faster than full backup, but slower than incremental. Easier to restore than incremental backups because you only need the last full backup and the most recent differential backup
	- Cons: Size grows over time, as each differential backup includes changes from the last full backup onward
- Incremental Backup:
	- Backs up only the data that has changed since the last backup (whether full or incremental)
	- Pros: Fastest and uses the least storage space
	- Cons: Slower to restore because you nned multiple sets of backup file
