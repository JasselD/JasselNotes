- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Fault tolerance</mark> is the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">prevention of data loss</mark> if a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">component fails</mark>
**Types:
- Full Backup:
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Complete copy of all data</mark> is made
	- Pros: Simple to restore
	- Cons: Time-consuming and requires a lot of storage
- Diffrential Backup: 
	- Backs up all the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">data that has changed since the last full backup</mark>
	- Pros: Faster than full backup, but <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">slower than incremental</mark>. Easier to restore than incremental backups because you only need the last full backup and the most recent differential backup
	- Cons: Size grows over time, as each differential backup includes changes from the last full backup onward
- Incremental Backup:
	- Backs up only the data that has changed since the last backup (whether full or incremental)
	- Pros: Fastest and uses the least storage space
	- Cons: Slower to restore because you nned multiple sets of backup files
- Copy Backup
	- A backup that is almost the same as full backup but does not interfere with your scheduled backups
	- Pros: Useful for ad hoc backups, like when performing system maintanance
	- Cons: Not part of your regular backup plan, so it may cause confusion if not managed properly
- Gratherfather-father-son Backup (GFS)
	- Rotation scheme used to manage and organize backups over time, ensuring multiple restore points while optimizing storage space
	- Son (Daily backup)
	- Father (Weekly backup)
	- Grandfather (Monthly backup)
	- Pros:
		- Multiple restore points
		- Efficient storage use
		- Easy organisation
	- Cons
		- Complexity
		- Storage (need significant size)
		- Retention gaps
