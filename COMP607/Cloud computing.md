- Provides <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">on-demand access</mark> to a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">shared pool of configurable resources</mark> such as <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">networks, servers, storage, applications, and services</mark>
- The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** defines cloud computing as:  
	- A model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
	- Key characteristics:
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">On-demand self-service</mark>:
			- Users can access computing resources such as storage or processing power as needed, without requiring human intervention from the service provider
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Broad network access</mark>:
			- Resources are available over the network and can be accessed via standard mechanisms (mobile apps, web browsers) by a wide range of devices such as smartphones, laptops...
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Resource pooling</mark>:
			- Cloud providers serve multilpe customers using pooled resources
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Rapid elasticity</mark>:
			- Resources can be quickly scaled up or down to meet varying user demand. Example, business and increase storage or processing power during peak times and reduce it when its no longer needed
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Measured service</mark>:
			- Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource usage through metering capabilities, so users are billed only for what they use

**Cloud Models
- 3 primary types
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
	- Provides <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">virtualized computing resources</mark> over the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">internet, including servers, storage, and networking</mark>
	- Users <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">manage applications, data, and operating systems</mark>, while the provider manages the underlying infrastructure
	- Example: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google cloud
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	- Provides a platform that allows developers to build, deploy and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure
	- The provider manages servers, storage, and networking, while users focus on application development
	- Examples: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, Heroku
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
	- Provides ready-to-use software applications over the internet
	- Users access applications through a web browser, and everything from infrastructure to software is managed by provider
	- Examples: Gmail, Microsoft 365, Salesforce
