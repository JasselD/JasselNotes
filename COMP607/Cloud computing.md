- Provides <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">on-demand access</mark> to a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">shared pool of configurable resources</mark> such as <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">networks, servers, storage, applications, and services</mark>
- The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** defines cloud computing as:  
	- A model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
	- Key characteristics:
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">On-demand self-service</mark>:
			- Users can access computing resources such as storage or processing power as needed, without requiring human intervention from the service provider
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Broad network access</mark>:
			- Resources are available over the network and can be accessed via standard mechanisms (mobile apps, web browsers) by a wide range of devices such as smartphones, laptops...
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Resource pooling</mark>:
			- Cloud providers serve multilpe customers using pooled resources
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Rapid elasticity</mark>:
			- Resources can be quickly scaled up or down to meet varying user demand. Example, business and increase storage or processing power during peak times and reduce it when its no longer needed
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Measured service</mark>:
			- Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource usage through metering capabilities, so users are billed only for what they use

**Cloud Models
- 3 primary types
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
	- Provides <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">virtualized computing resources</mark> over the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">internet, including servers, storage, and networking</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Users manage applications, data, and operating systems</mark>, while the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">provider manages the underlying infrastructure</mark>
	- Example: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google cloud
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	- Provides a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">platform that allows developers to build, deploy and manage applications</mark> without worrying about the underlying infrastructure
	- The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">provider manages servers, storage, and networking</mark>, while <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">users focus on application development</mark>
	- Examples: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, Heroku
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
	- Provides <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">ready-to-use software applications over the internet</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Users access applications through a web browser</mark>, and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">everything from infrastructure to software is managed by provider</mark>
	- Examples: Gmail, Microsoft 365, Salesforce

**Cloud Deployment Models
- Definition: Where the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">cloud infrastructure is located and who controls it</mark>
- Types:
	- Public cloud:
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers</mark>, and the infrastructure is shared among multiple users
		- Accessible over the internet and typically offers lower costs and scalability
		- Examples: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure
	- Private cloud:
		- Cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by a single organisation. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider
		- Offers great control and security but can be more costly and complex to manage
		- Example: A bank hosting its internal cloud services
	- Hybrid cloud:
		- A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them
		- Organisations can use the public cloud for non-sensitive workloads while keeping critical workloads on a private cloud
		- Offers flexibility and the ability to scale as needeed
	- Community cloud:
		- Cloud infrastructure is shared by several organisations with a common goal or regulatory requirements
		- It can be managed by one or more of the participating organisations or a third party
