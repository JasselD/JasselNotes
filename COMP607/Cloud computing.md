- Provides on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable resources such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and services
- The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** defines cloud computing as:  
	- A model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
	- Key characteristics:
		- On-demand self-service:
			- Users can access computing resources such as storage or processing power as needed, without requiring human intervention from the service provider
		- Broad network access:
			- Resources are available over the network and can be accessed via standard mechanisms (mobile apps, web browsers) by a wide range of devices such as smartphones, laptops...
		- Resource pooling:
			- Cloud providers serve multilpe customers using pooled resources
		- Rapid elasticity:
			- Resources can be quickly scaled up or down to meet varying user demand. Example, business and increase storage or processing power during peak times and reduce it when its no longer needed
		- Measured service:
			- Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource usage through metering capabilities, so users are billed only for what they use

**Cloud Models
- 3 primary types
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
	- Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, and networking
	- Users manage applications, data, and operating systems, while the provider manages the underlying infrastructure
