**Types:
- Hot site:
	- Fully functional, fully equiped site that can take over business operations almost immediately if the primary site goes down
	- Pros: Fast recovery
	- Cons: Expensive to maintain
- Cold site:
	- A location with basic infrastructure (eg. office space, network connections), but no operational hardware or data. It takes longer to get up and running
	- Pros: Cheap to maintain
	- Cons: Long recovery time 
- Warm site:
	- A middle ground between hot and cold sites. It has pre-installed hardware and network connections but might need updates or additional equipment to become fully operational
	- Pros: Faster recovery than cold site and cheaper than hot site
	- Cons: Still involves some downtime
