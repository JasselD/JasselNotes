**Types of Wireless Attacks
- Rogue APs
	- Definition: An unauthorized access point set up within the network
	- Threat: Allows attackets to bypass network security measures (like firewalls) and gain access to the internal network
	- Impact: Once an attacker conencts through a rogue AP, they can exploit vulnerabilities behind the firewall, compromising the network and its user
- Evil Twin
	- Definition: An access point set up by an attacker to mimic a legitimate authorised AP
	- Threat: Designed to trick users into connecting to it instead of the legitimate AP
	- How it works: User's device (laptops, tablets) unknowingly connect to evil twin, allowing attackers to capture their data transmissions
