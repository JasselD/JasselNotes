- Redundant Array of Independetn Disks (RAID)
- A technology that combines multiple physical hard drives into one unit for redundancy or performance
- Types:
	- RAID 0 (Striping)
		- Data is split evenly across two or more disks to improve performance
		- Pros: Increased read/write speeds
		- Cons: No redundancy. If one disk fails, all data is lost
	- RAID 1 (Mirroring)
		- Data is duplicated on two or more disks, so each disk holds the same data
		- Pros: Redundancy; if one disk fails, the other still has the data
		- Cons: Reduced storage effieciency (need twice the storage). Slower write speeds
	- RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)
		- Data is split across three or more disks, with parity information distributed across all disks. Parity allows recovery if a disk fails
		- Pros: Redundancy and good storage effiency
		- Cons: Slower write speeds due to parity calculations. Recovery can take time
