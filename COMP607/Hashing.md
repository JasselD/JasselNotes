- Process of scrambling a piece of information or data beyond recognition
- Designed to be irreversible
- Need to pass the input through a hash function to calculate the Hash value or Diges
- Hash function is an algorithm used to encrypt a string and the output is called hash value
- Each hash value must be unique
- Will not reveal passwords in a data breach because there is no encryption needed
- Hashing is also called one-way hash
- A process for creating unique "signature" for a set of data
	- This signature is called a hash or digest
- Used to ensure that information is in its original form
- Does not prevent the message from being read and understood
- Used for authentication if supported by something else
