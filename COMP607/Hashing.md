- Process of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">scrambling a piece of information or data beyond recognition</mark>
- Designed to be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">irreversible</mark>
- Need to pass the input through a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Hash Function</mark> to calculate the<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> Hash Value</mark> or <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Digest</mark>
- Hash function is an <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">algorithm used to encrypt a string</mark> 
- Each hash value must be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">unique</mark>
- Will not reveal passwords in a data breach because there is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">no encryption needed</mark>
- Hashing is also called <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">one-way hash</mark>
- Used to ensure that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">information is in its original form</mark>
- Does not prevent the message from being read and understood
- Used for authentication if supported by something else

**Hash Function
- Mathematical operations to be carried out on two blocks of data
- Both blocks are created by dii
