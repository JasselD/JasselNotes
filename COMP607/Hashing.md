- Process of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">scrambling a piece of information or data beyond recognition</mark>
- Designed to be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">irreversible</mark>
- Need to pass the input through a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Hash Function</mark> to calculate the Hash Value or Digest
- Hash function is an algorithm used to encrypt a string and the output is called hash value
- Each hash value must be unique
- Will not reveal passwords in a data breach because there is no encryption needed
- Hashing is also called one-way hash
- Used to ensure that information is in its original form
- Does not prevent the message from being read and understood
- Used for authentication if supported by something else
