**Worm
- Can spread itself across computers and networks without any human interaction
- Malware that self-replicates
	- Doesn't need you to do anything
	- Uses the network as a transmission medium
	- Self-propagates and spreads quickly
- Can replicate in the speed of the user's network
- Firewalls and IDS/IPS can prevent worm infestations
	- Is not that effective if worms are already in
- Example: Wannacry worm 

**Virus
- Attaches itself to a legitimate file or program and spreads from one computer to another when the infected file or program is executed
- Typically requires user action: Opening a file, clicking on a link
- Once the virus is activated, it can replicate itself and infect other files or programs on the same computer, it can also spread to other computers when infected files are shared via USB, emails or downloads
- Example: Melissa virus
