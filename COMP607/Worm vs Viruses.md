**Worm
- Can spread itself across computers and networks without any human interaction
- Malware that self-replicates
	- Doesn't need you to do anything
	- Uses the network as a transmission medium
	- Self-propagates and spreads quickly
- Can replicate in the speed of the user's network
- Firewalls and IDS/IPS can prevent worm infestations
	- Is not that effective if worms are already in
- Example: Wannacry worm 

**Virus
- Attaches itself to a legitimate file or program and spreads from one computer to another when the infected file or program is executed
- Typically requires user action: Opening a file, clicking on a link
- Once the virus is activated, it can replicate itself and infect other files or programs on the same computer, it can also spread to other computers when infected files are shared via USB, emails or downloads
- Example: Melissa virus

**Differences between virus and worm
- Spread mechanism
	- Virus: Requires user action to spread
	- Worm: Self-replicates and spreads automatically without user interaction
- Attachment
	- Virus: Needs to attach itself to a file, program, or document as a host
	- Worm: Does not attach to other files; it operates as a standalone program
- Activation
	- Virus: Only becomes active when the infected file or program is opened or executed by the user
	- Worm: Can start spreading and infecting systems as soon as it enters a computer or network
- Spreading
	- Virus: Spreads through infected files, email attachments, downloads or USB drives
	- Worm: Spreads primarily via network vulnerabilities, often moving through systems without any human involvement
- Harm
	- Virus: Can be designed to corrupt files, steal data, or slow systems
	- Worm: Often designed to spread rapidly, causing network congestion and system slowdowns
- Speed of sp
