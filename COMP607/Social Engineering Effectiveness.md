***7 principles

**Authority
- Description: To impersonate an authority figure or falsely cite their authority to pressure the victim into compliance
- How it works: People tend to follow orders or requests from authority figures without question
- Example: An attacker poses as the CEO and requests sensitive information or access to systems, making the victim feel they must comply due to the perceived power imbalance

**Intimidation
- Description: To use threats or aggressive language to frighten or coerce the victim into action
- How it works: Fear can make people act hastily, often overriding rational decision-making
- Example: An attacker threatens to report an employee to their supervisor if they don’t reset a password or provide access, creating a sense of fear and urgency

**Consensus (Social Proof)
- Description: Convinces the victim by referencing what others have done similiar situations, making the victim feel that it's a standard or expected action
- How it works: People are more likely to act if they believe others have done the same
- Example: The attacker tells the victim that a colleague previously reset the password for them, creating the illusion that it’s normal procedure and pressuring the victim to do the same

**Scarcity
- Description: Attacker claims that a resource or opportunity is in short supply, pressuring the victim to act quickly before it's too late
- How it works: People are more likely to act when they believe they might miss out on something important or rare
- Example: The attacker claims they are short on time and need immediate help, creating a sense of urgency that compels the victims to bypass normal security procedures

**Urgency
- Description: The attacker emphasized that immediate action is necessary, forcing the victim to act quickly without throughly thinking it through
- How it works: Time pressure can cloud judgement, leading to rushed decisions
- Example: The attacker claims they have a meeting with the board of directors in five minutes and urgently need a password reset or access to certain files

**Familiarity
- Descripton: Pretends to know the victim's personally or expresses positive familiarity to build rapport and reduce suspicion
- How it works: People are more likely to trust and help someone they believe they know or have a friendly connection with
- Example: The attacker tells the victim they’ve heard good things about them or met them at a previous company event, building false familiarity to gain the victim’s trust

**Trust
- Description: The attacker inspires confidence by acting trustworthy or referencing mutual connections, making the victim more likely to comply
- How it works: People are more likely to comply with requests from someone they believe is trustworthy
- Example: The attacker claims to be a known individual or uses professional language and tone to project confidence and reliability, tricking the victim into divulging information or performing actions
