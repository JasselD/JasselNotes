**Trapdoors
- Type of cryptographic algorithm or system that contains a hidden mechanism, which is called a trapdoor. This enables someone with special knowledge to bypass security measures that would be difficult or impossible to breach
- Trapdoor program is built around a trapdoor function. It's a mathematical function that is easy to compute in one direction but hard to reverse unless you have special information (the trapdoor)
- RSA algorithm is an example of trapdoor function
