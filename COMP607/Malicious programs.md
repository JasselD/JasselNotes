**Trapdoors
- Type of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">cryptographic algorithm</mark> or system that contains a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">hidden mechanism</mark>, which is called a trapdoor. This enables someone with special knowledge to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">bypass security measures</mark> that would be difficult or impossible to breach
- Trapdoor program is built around a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">trapdoor function</mark>. It's a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">mathematical function</mark> that is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">easy to compute in one direction but hard to reverse</mark> unless you have <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">special information</mark> (the trapdoor)
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">RSA algorithm</mark> is an example of trapdoor function

**Logic bombs 
- Type of malicious code that is hidden within a computer program and is set to execute a harmful action when certain conditions are met
- Logic bombs stays dormant until a specific event or condition occurs
- Hidden code: Logic bombs is secretly placed within a legitimate program or system. It remains inactive and hidden until triggered by a certain condition
- Trigger condition: A specific data or time, the presence or absence of certain data, a particular user action 
- Outcomes: Deleting files, corrupting data, slowing down or crashing systems

**Trojan horse
- Disguises itself as a legitimate or useful program to trick users into installing or using it
- Trojans do not replicate themselves this relying on the user to install or execute them
- Outcomes: Steal sensitive information, Spy on users, take control of computers, install additional malware
